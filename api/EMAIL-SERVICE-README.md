The `avaliable.pro` domain has been authenticated with SendGrid:

1. ✅ DNS records added to Namecheap:
   - CNAME: em7768 → u57175397.wl148.sendgrid.net
   - CNAME: s1.\_domainkey → s1.domainkey.u57175397.wl148.sendgrid.net

3. ✅ Emails now sent from `bookings@avaliable.pro`
4. ✅ Professional appearance - no "via sendgrid.net"
5. ✅ Excellent deliverability - emails go to inbox, not spam

## 📝 Error Handling

The email service includes comprehensive error handling:

- Logs all email attempts
- Shows SendGrid error details if sending fails
- Returns error messages for debugging
- Doesn't crash your booking process if emails fail

## 💡 Tips

- **Test thoroughly** before going live
- **Check spam folders** during testing
- **Log email failures** for monitoring
- **Consider retry queue** for failed emails in production
- **Send emails asynchronously** to avoid blocking booking creation

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

**Emails not arriving?**

1. Check spam/junk folder
2. Verify SendGrid API key is correct
3. Check SendGrid dashboard for delivery status
4. Ensure `SENDGRID_API_KEY` is in `.env`

**Getting SendGrid errors?**

1. Check API key is valid (not expired)
2. Verify email addresses are valid
3. Check SendGrid account status (not suspended)
4. Review error message in console

**"via sendgrid.net" showing?**

- This is normal until you set up sender authentication
- Doesn't affect deliverability, just how sender appears

✅ **Ready to use!** Your email service is fully configured and tested.
