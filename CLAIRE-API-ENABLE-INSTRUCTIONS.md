## 🎉 Great News!

I received your API keys and they're **partially working**! Here's what I found:

✅ **Authentication**: WORKING! The keys can connect to SimplyBook.me  
✅ **Webhook URL**: PERFECT! Configured correctly  
✅ **All triggers**: Enabled correctly  
✅ **Retries**: Set to 3 correctly

❌ **API Permissions**: Need to be enabled

## 🔧 One Quick Fix Needed

The API keys are authenticating, but they don't have permission to read data yet. This is a simple toggle in SimplyBook.me.

### Here's What To Do (2 minutes):

1. **Go back to the same page** you were just on (Custom Features → API)

2. **Look for an "Enable" or "Activate" button** near the top of the page
   - It might say "Enable API" or "Activate API"
   - Sometimes there's a toggle switch

3. **OR look for "API Permissions" or "API Access"** settings
   - There might be checkboxes for:
     - ☐ Read booking data
     - ☐ Create bookings
     - ☐ Modify bookings
     - ☐ Access company info
   - **Check ALL of them**

4. **Click Save**

5. **Take a screenshot** and send it to me

## 📸 What to Look For

In your API settings page, look for something like:

- "API Status: Disabled" → Change to "Enabled"
- "Enable API Access" button
- Checkboxes for different API permissions
- A toggle switch that says "API" that's currently OFF

---

## 🤔 Alternative: Check If API Plugin is Fully Enabled

1. Go to **Settings** → **Plugins** (in the left sidebar)
2. Find **"API"** in the plugin list
3. Make sure it shows as **"Active"** or **"Enabled"**
4. If not, click to enable it
5. Then go back to **Custom Features** → **API**

---

## 📱 Send Me

Once you do this, just send me:

- Screenshot of the API page showing it's enabled/active
- Or just message: "Done - API is now enabled"

Then I'll test again and we should be 100% operational!

## ❓ Can't Find It?

If you can't find any "Enable" button or permissions checkboxes:

- Take a screenshot of the entire API page
- Send it to me
- I'll point out exactly where to click

**You're SO close! Literally one button away from completion!** 🚀
