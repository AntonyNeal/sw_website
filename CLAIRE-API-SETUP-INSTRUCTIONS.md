# 🎯 Action Required: SimplyBook.me API Setup

**Dear Claire,** 👋

We're ready to integrate the SimplyBook.me booking system directly into your website! This will give your visitors a seamless booking experience without leaving your site.

## 📋 What I Need From You

I need **3 pieces of information** from your SimplyBook.me account to complete the integration:

1. **Company Login** (your unique company name)
2. **API Key** (your secret access key)
3. **API URL** (usually: `https://user-api.simplybook.me`)

---

## 🔑 How To Get Your API Credentials

### Step 1: Log Into SimplyBook.me

1. Go to: **https://simplybook.me/login**
2. Log in with your account credentials
3. You'll land on your dashboard

### Step 2: Navigate to API Settings

1. Click on **"Settings"** (⚙️ gear icon) in the top-right corner
2. In the left sidebar, look for **"Integrations"** or **"API"**
3. Click on **"API Settings"** or **"Custom API"**

### Step 3: Enable API Access (If Not Already Enabled)

1. You might see a toggle or button that says **"Enable API Access"**
2. Turn it **ON** if it's not already enabled
3. This allows external applications (like your website) to communicate with your booking system

### Step 4: Copy Your Credentials

You'll see two key pieces of information:

#### 📌 Company Login

- This is your unique company identifier
- It looks like: `clairehamilton` or `claire-companion-services`
- **Copy this exactly as shown**

#### 🔐 API Key

- This is a long string of letters and numbers
- It looks like: `a7b3c9d2e5f8a1b4c6d8e9f2a3b5c7d9`
- **Keep this secret!** Don't share it publicly
- Click the **"Copy"** or **"Show"** button to reveal it
- **Copy the entire key**

#### 🌐 API URL

- This is usually: `https://user-api.simplybook.me`
- Some accounts might use a different endpoint
- If you see a specific URL listed, copy that instead

---

## 📧 Send Me The Information

**Please send me these 3 items via email or secure message:**

```
Company Login: [your company name here]
API Key: [your long API key here]
API URL: https://user-api.simplybook.me
```

### 🔒 Security Note

The API Key is **sensitive information** - treat it like a password! Don't post it in public channels or share it with anyone else. Email or a private message is best.

## ❓ Troubleshooting: Can't Find API Settings?

### Option A: Search for "API" in Settings

- Use the search box in your SimplyBook.me dashboard
- Type "API" and it should show you the right page

### Option B: Check Your Plan

- API access might require a specific subscription level
- You're on the **Standard Plan ($24.90/month)** which **includes API access**
- If you don't see API settings, contact SimplyBook.me support (they respond within 1 hour!)

### Option C: Alternative Location

Sometimes the API settings are under:

- **Settings → Plugins → Custom Features → API**
- **Settings → Advanced → API Settings**
- **Settings → Custom Code → API Access**

### Option D: Contact SimplyBook.me Support

If you still can't find it:

1. Click the **chat icon** (💬) in the bottom-right corner of your dashboard
2. Say: _"I need to enable API access to integrate with my website. Where do I find my API key?"_
3. They'll walk you through it! (Usually responds in minutes)

## ⏱️ How Long Will This Take?

- **Finding the settings:** 2-3 minutes
- **Copying the credentials:** 1 minute
- **Sending them to me:** 1 minute

**Total time: ~5 minutes!** ⚡
