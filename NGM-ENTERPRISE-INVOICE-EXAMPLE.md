## 💡 Cost Comparison Analysis

### **Claire's Estimated Business Revenue**

**Assumptions:**

- 10 bookings per week (similar to "John" bookings)
- Average service: 2-hour companion booking @ $800/booking
- Operating weeks: 48 weeks/year (4 weeks vacation/slow periods)

**Annual Revenue Calculation:**

- Weekly: 10 bookings × $800 = $8,000/week
- Annual: $8,000/week × 48 weeks = **$384,000/year**
- Monthly average: **$32,000/month**

### **Fairy Godmother Terms: Revenue Share Model**

**Payment Structure:**

- **20% of gross booking revenue** processed through the website
- **Referral bonus:** $50 coupon credit per qualified referral that books
- **Minimum monthly payment:** $0 (only pay on revenue generated)
- **Payment timing:** Monthly, 30 days after end of each month

**Annual Value to Developer (at full capacity):**

- 20% × $384,000 = **$76,800/year** ($6,400/month average)
- Estimated referrals: 24/year × $50 = $1,200 in coupon credits
- **Net annual value:** ~$75,600/year

**First Year Ramp-Up (Conservative):**

- Months 1-3: 3-5 bookings/week = $1,920-3,200/month → **$384-640/month to developer**
- Months 4-6: 5-7 bookings/week = $3,200-4,480/month → **$640-896/month to developer**
- Months 7-12: 7-10 bookings/week = $4,480-6,400/month → **$896-1,280/month to developer**
- **First year total estimate:** $16,000-24,000

### **What Claire Would Pay: NGM vs. Fairy Godmother**

| Scenario                      | NGM Upfront | NGM Monthly | Fairy Godmother Upfront | Fairy Godmother Monthly | Upfront Savings |
| ----------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------- | ----------------------- | --------------- |
| **Current Project Only**      | ~$115,000   | ~$3,500     | $0                      | ~$6,400                 | ~$115,000       |
| **With Background Screening** | ~$128,000   | ~$4,000     | $0                      | ~$6,600                 | ~$128,000       |
| **With A/B Testing**          | ~$134,000   | ~$4,500     | $0                      | ~$6,800                 | ~$134,000       |
| **Full Enterprise Setup**     | ~$155,000   | ~$5,500     | $0                      | ~$7,200                 | ~$155,000       |

_All figures approximate. NGM monthly = support retainer + infrastructure. Fairy Godmother monthly = 20% revenue share at full capacity + infrastructure costs paid by Claire._

### **Total Cost Comparison Over Time**

**Year 1 Total Costs (Current Project Only):**

- **NGM:** ~$115,000 upfront + (~$3,500 × 12 months) = **~$157,000**
- **Fairy Godmother:** $0 upfront + (~$6,400 × 12 months) = **~$77,000** (at full capacity)
- **Claire's Year 1 Savings:** ~$80,000

**Year 2 Total Costs:**

- **NGM:** (~$3,500 × 12 months) = **~$42,000**
- **Fairy Godmother:** (~$6,400 × 12 months) = **~$77,000** (at full capacity)
- **NGM becomes cheaper in Year 2** by ~$35,000

**Break-Even Point:**

- NGM's upfront cost (~$115,000) ÷ Monthly difference (~$2,900) = **~40 months** (~3.3 years)
- After ~3.3 years at full capacity, NGM's total cost equals Fairy Godmother's total cost
- Before that point, Fairy Godmother is cheaper due to $0 upfront
- **Key advantage:** Fairy Godmother has zero risk - payment scales with actual revenue
