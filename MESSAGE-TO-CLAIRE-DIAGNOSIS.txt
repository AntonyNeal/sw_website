Hey Claire!

I ran a comprehensive diagnostic test on your API and found the issue:

**Good News:**
✅ Your API key is working perfectly
✅ Authentication is successful  
✅ Connection to SimplyBook is solid

**The Problem:**
❌ Your API key has ZERO permissions enabled
❌ Every single method returns "Access denied" - even basic ones like viewing your services

This means either:
1. Your subscription plan doesn't include API access, OR
2. SimplyBook needs to manually enable permissions for your account

**What you need to do:**

1. Check your plan first:
   - Go to Settings → Subscription (or Billing)
   - What plan are you on?
   - Does it mention "API Access" or "Developer Access"?

2. Email SimplyBook support at: support@simplybook.me

Subject: API Permissions Not Working - clairehamilton

Hi SimplyBook Support Team,

I need help enabling API permissions for my account.

Account Details:
• Company Login: clairehamilton
• Issue: All API methods return "Access denied" (error code -32600)

What I've tried:
1. Generated new API keys
2. Saved the configuration
3. Tested authentication - tokens generate successfully  
4. Tested multiple API methods - ALL return "Access denied"

I'm trying to integrate my booking system with my website. The API key authenticates successfully, but no methods are accessible.

Can you please:
1. Enable full API permissions for my account
2. Confirm which subscription plan is required for API access
3. Let me know if there's a setting I'm missing

Thank you for your help!

Best regards,
Claire Hamilton

They should respond within 1-2 business days. Once they enable permissions, we can go live same day!

Let me know what plan you're on and what they say.

Julian 😊
