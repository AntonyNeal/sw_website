## 🆚 Why SimplyBook.me Over The Others?

### vs YouCanBookMe:

❌ **No native apps** - Just mobile website (not the same!)  
❌ **Less privacy focus** - Consumer-grade, not professional  
❌ **Email support only** - No live chat when stuck

✅ **SimplyBook wins:** Real apps, better privacy, 24/7 help 🏆

### vs Cal.com:

❌ **Too technical** - Built for developers, not for you  
❌ **No native apps** - Web only  
❌ **Steeper learning curve** - Would take you months  
❌ **Community support only** - No dedicated help team

✅ **SimplyBook wins:** User-friendly, real apps, human support 🏆

### vs Acuity:

❌ **Squarespace bias** - They push their website builder  
❌ **Less intuitive** - More complicated interface  
❌ **Basic mobile app** - Not as polished  
❌ **No 24/7 chat** - Email/ticket system only

✅ **SimplyBook wins:** Better apps, live chat, cleaner design 🏆
