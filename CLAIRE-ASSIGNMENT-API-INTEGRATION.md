# 🎬 MISSION BRIEFING: Operation SimplyBook

**Classification:** CONFIDENTIAL  
**Agent:** Claire Hamilton (Platform Owner)  
**Tech Ops:** [Developer Name] (Handles all coding/server work)  
**Mission Date:** November 12, 2025  
**Time Limit:** 15-20 minutes  
**Status:** ACTIVE

---

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: YOUR ROLE

**YOU (Claire) handle:** SimplyBook.me dashboard configuration, generating API keys, business settings  
**TECH OPS handles:** All coding, server configuration, database work, technical implementation

**Your mission involves ZERO coding.** Just simple dashboard clicks in SimplyBook.me and sending information to your developer.

---

## 🎯 MISSION OBJECTIVES

Good morning, Claire. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, involves completing the final phase of the SimplyBook.me integration. Our technical team has successfully infiltrated 88% of the system. The remaining 12% requires your unique access credentials to activate the live connection.

**Current Integration Status:** ⚠️ DEGRADED (awaiting agent credentials)  
**Target Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL

**This message will not self-destruct** (you'll need it for reference).

---

## 🔐 PHASE 1: ACQUIRE AUTHENTICATION CODES

**Objective:** Extract fresh API credentials from SimplyBook.me headquarters  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ LOW  
**Time Required:** 5 minutes  
**Failure Risk:** None (keys can be regenerated infinitely)

**INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING:**  
The API keys from the previous reconnaissance mission appear to be decoys. You must infiltrate the SimplyBook.me system and generate genuine access codes.

**MISSION STEPS:**

1. **INFILTRATE THE MAINFRAME**
   - Access point: https://simplybook.me/
   - Use your authenticated credentials
   - Status: Awaiting agent entry

2. **NAVIGATE TO THE VAULT**
   - Target location: **Settings** → **For Development** → **API**
   - Security clearance: Already granted
   - Proceed with caution

3. **ACTIVATE KEY GENERATION PROTOCOL**
   - Locate: **"Generate new keys"** command button
   - Execute: Single click
   - Result: Two classified code strings will materialize

4. **EXTRACT THE CODES**
   - **Primary Key** (API Key): Long alphanumeric sequence
   - **Master Key** (Secret API Key): Secondary alphanumeric sequence
   - **⚠️ CRITICAL:** These codes grant full system access - maintain OPSEC

5. **TRANSMIT TO TECH OPS**
   - Secure channel only (encrypted email/direct message)
   - Template provided in EXFIL section below
   - Do NOT broadcast on unsecured channels

**MISSION STATUS:** [ ] INCOMPLETE

---

## 📡 PHASE 2: ESTABLISH COMMUNICATION RELAY

**Objective:** Configure secure webhook transmission channel  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ LOW  
**Time Required:** 3 minutes  
**Mission Critical:** YES - enables real-time intelligence

**INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING:**  
Install a covert listening post that will relay all booking intelligence (create/change/cancel operations) directly to your command center.

**MISSION STEPS:**

1. **RETURN TO THE VAULT**
   - You should still be in: Settings → API
   - If not, re-infiltrate (see Phase 1, steps 1-2)

2. **LOCATE TRANSMISSION CONTROLS**
   - Scroll to: **"Callback URL"** section
   - This is your secure uplink configuration

3. **INSTALL THE RELAY COORDINATES**
   - Enter this EXACT secure endpoint:

   ```
   https://api.clairehamilton.net/api/v1/webhooks/simplybook
   ```

   - **⚠️ CRITICAL:** One typo will break the communication link

4. **CONFIGURE RETRY PROTOCOL**
   - Set **"Number of API retries"** to: `3`
   - This ensures message delivery even under adverse conditions

5. **VERIFY TRIGGER MECHANISMS** (should auto-detect as ARMED):
   - ✅ Trigger on create (new bookings detected)
   - ✅ Trigger on change (modifications detected)
   - ✅ Trigger on cancel (cancellations detected)
   - ✅ Trigger on remind (reminder signals detected)

6. **ACTIVATE THE RELAY**
   - Execute: **"Save"** command
   - Wait for confirmation signal

7. **DOCUMENT FOR VERIFICATION**
   - Capture screen evidence (screenshot)
   - Transmit to Tech Ops for validation

**MISSION STATUS:** [ ] INCOMPLETE

---

## 🔍 PHASE 3: VERIFY COVER IDENTITY

**Objective:** Confirm operational business intelligence  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ TRIVIAL  
**Time Required:** 2 minutes  
**Status:** RECONNAISSANCE

**MISSION STEPS:**

1. **ACCESS BUSINESS DOSSIER**
   - Navigate: Settings → Business Info
   - Review classified information

2. **VERIFY IDENTITY DETAILS:**
   - Codename: Claire Hamilton
   - Contact coordinates: [verify email]
   - Communication line: [verify phone]
   - Base of operations: [verify address]

3. **UPDATE IF COMPROMISED**
   - Modify any incorrect intelligence
   - Execute: Save command

**MISSION STATUS:** [ ] INCOMPLETE

---

## 🎯 PHASE 4: DEPLOY SERVICE MODULES

**Objective:** Activate available booking services  
**Difficulty:** ⭐ LOW  
**Time Required:** 5 minutes (if services not yet deployed)  
**Status:** OPTIONAL (may already be complete)

**INTELLIGENCE BRIEFING:**  
At least one service package must be operational for the booking system to function.

**MISSION STEPS:**

1. **ACCESS SERVICE DEPLOYMENT**
   - Navigate: Settings → Services
   - Assess current deployment status

2. **DEPLOY NEW SERVICE** (if arsenal is empty):
   - Execute: "Add Service" command
   - Configure parameters:
     - Designation: (e.g., "1-Hour Session", "2-Hour Operation")
     - Duration: (mission length in minutes)
     - Cost: (operational budget)
     - Description: (mission parameters)

3. **SAVE AND ARM**
   - Confirm deployment
   - Repeat for additional service types as needed

**MISSION STATUS:** [ ] INCOMPLETE
