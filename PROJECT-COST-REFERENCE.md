## 📋 What This Document Is

Hi Claire! 👋

This is a **reference guide** to help you understand what this website project would typically cost in the commercial market. This information is specifically designed to help you in **our payment negotiation** - I want you to have full transparency about the real market value of the work so you can make informed decisions about what's fair.

This is NOT an invoice, and it's not me demanding any specific amount. Think of it as your secret weapon for understanding value in our conversations about payment. I'm showing you what others would charge, so you know what you're getting and we can figure out together what makes sense for both of us.

Consider this information from your Fairy Godmother who wants you to have all the facts! ✨
