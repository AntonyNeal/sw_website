Perfect! Now we're deploying. Here's what to enter for each prompt:

1. Set up and deploy
Answer: yes

2. Which scope should contain your project?
Answer: Life Psychology Australia (this is fine for now)

3. Link to existing project?
Answer: no (we want a new project)

4. What's your project's name?
Answer: clairehamilton-booking-platform

This will:

✅ Create a new project under your existing team
✅ Deploy Claire's booking platform with BuildHub tenant
✅ Generate a live URL immediately
✅ Set up for custom domain (clairehamilton.net) later
Type yes first to confirm the deployment setup, then follow with the other answers when prompted.

You can always move this to a separate team later once the payment method issue is resolved, but this gets Claire's site live immediately!
